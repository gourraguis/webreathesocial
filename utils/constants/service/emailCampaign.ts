      `Email marketing can be a follow-up step after lead generation. It can be a separate step depending upon your purpose of email marketing. Email marketing can be of different types. It can be just for your past and current clients. For example, it can be for reminding them to use your services again and what new offers and products you have launched. It can also be for giving them some special discount for being a part of your business earlier. If email marketing is to be done after lead generation, then you can send creative emails to the interested visitors and convert them into your clients. Email marketing helps you connect well with your audience. A correct email sent at the correct time can increase your sales greatly.
